# Hyperplan Backend

Backend Framework for Small to Medium sized machine learning teams.

## Purpose

At Hyperplan, I identified that not every machine learning teams need big frameworks such as KubeFlow or TensorFlow Serving.
The goal of Hyperplan Backend is to make it easy for you to serve machine learning, in a reliable and extendable way.

 - *Serving* lets your clients execute your algorithms great performance using Gunicorn and Falcon.
 - *Hooks* extends functionalities of your machine learning applications with hooks, side effectful functions that are executed with your algorithm data.
